# Air-Quality-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting air quality using machine learning techniques. 
You will build a model to analyze and forecast air pollution levels based on historical data. 
This hands-on experience will help you understand how to preprocess time-series data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.
